# Programming Coursework at Indiana University Bloomington
This is a collection of my Computer Science coursework from classes that I have completed so far at IU.
For each course, I've listed a brief summary of the topics we discussed in the course, as well as links
to some of the major projects and assignments for each course.

### Data Structures (CSCI-C343)
All data structures assignments were completed in Java. This was by far the most
important course I took at IU. I learned a lot about various topics and fundamental
Computer Science data structures. Some of the important things we covered in my class
were:

-Runtime Analysis (Big-O)
-Balanced Binary Search Trees
-Hash Tables, Heaps, Priority Queues
-Graphs and Search Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)
-Sorting (Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort)
-Dynamic Programming
