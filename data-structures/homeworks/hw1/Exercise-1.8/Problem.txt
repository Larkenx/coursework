Imagine that you have been assigned to implement a simple sequential search
on an array. The problem is that you want the search to be as general as possible.
This means that you need to support arbitrary record and key types.
Describe ways to generalize the search function to support this goal. Consider
the possibility that the function will be used multiple times in the same
program, on differing record types. Consider the possibility that the function
will need to be used on different keys (possibly with the same or different
types) of the same record. For example, a student data record might be
searched by zip code, by name, by salary, or by GPA.
