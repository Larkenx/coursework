Binary Search Algorithm (p48 Shaffer):

Example 2.7 Consider the binary search algorithm for finding a given value within an array sorted by value from lowest to highest. Binary search first looks at the middle element and determines if the value being searched for is in the upper half or the lower half of the array. The algorithm then continues splitting the appropriate subarray in half until the desired value is found. (Binary search is described in more detail in Section 3.5.) How many times can an array of size n be split in half until only one element remains in the final subarray? The answer is ⌈log2 n⌉ times.

array.length = 100;

100 => 50 => 25 => 12 => 6 => 3 => 1
6 operations versus 100, or [log2>100] ~= 6.6
