# Chapter 10 (B-trees)
### 10.11
Show the result of inserting the value 55 into the B-tree of Figure 10.17
```
                            [24, 45]
                /               |               \

# Chapter 11 (Graphs)
### 11.3
(a) Draw the adjacency matrix representation for the graph of Figure 11.26.
```
x marks a "true" boolean value in the 2d matrix

   1 2 3 4 5 6
   _ _ _ _ _ _
1 |x x   x   x
2 |x x x x
3 |  x x   x
4 |x x   x x x
5 |    x x x x
6 |x     x x x
```
(b) Draw the adjacency list representation for the same graph.
```
1 -> [2, 3, 4]
2 -> [1, 3, 4]
3 -> [2, 5]
4 -> [1, 2, 5, 6]
5 -> [3, 4, 6]
6 -> [1, 4, 5]
```

### 11.4
Show the DFS tree for the graph of Figure 11.26, starting at Vertex 1.
```
1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
```

### 11.6
Show the BFS tree for the graph of Figure 11.26, starting at Vertex 1.
```
       [1]
      /    \
   [2]     [6]
   /       /  \
[3]       [5]  [4]

```


##### *I worked with Chris Felli on the last two problems here*

### 11.10
Show the shortest paths generated by running Dijkstra’s shortest-paths algorithm
on the graph of Figure 11.26, beginning at Vertex 4. Show the D
values as each vertex is processed, as in Figure 11.19

```
INF INF  INF 0 INF INF
20   5   INF 0 11  10
20   5   INF 0 11  10
20   5   15  0 11  10
20   5   15  0 11  10
20   5   15  0 11  10
20   5   15  0 11  10
```


### 11.18
List the order in which the edges of the graph in Figure 11.26 are visited
when running Kruskal’s MST algorithm. Each time an edge is added to the
MST, show the result on the equivalence array, (e.g., show the array as in
Figure 6.7).

```
1 --> 6 --> 5 --> 4 --> 2 --> 3.

Results:
--------
10  20  x  x  x  2

2  x  x  10  3  x

x  x  15  11  x  3

20  5  x  x  11  10

10  x  33  5  x  x
```
